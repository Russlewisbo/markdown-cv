# Russell Edward Lewis
Associate Professor and Clinical Pharmacologist

I am an Associate Professor of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences as the University of Bologna and a clinical pharmacist. I have over 20 years experience in laboratory and clinical research of antimicrobial and antifungal PK/PD in immunocompromised hosts. My current research focuses on the development of prognostic risk models and decision support tools for the diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections and multidrug resistant bacteria.
